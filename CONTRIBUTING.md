# Contributing to Microbox

Microbox is an open source project powered by volunteers that use their time to submit code and thus make the project better every day. Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Contributions

Contributions to Microbox should be in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to merge). The pull request can then be merged, feedback can be added, changes requested, or the pull request can be denied. All contributions should follow this format, even those from core contributors.

## Questions & Support

We use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests and have limited bandwidth to address all of them. Thus we only accept bug reports, new feature requests, and pull requests in GitHub. Our great community and contributors are happy to help you though! Please use these community resources for obtaining help.

* Come join the Microbox [Discord](https://discord.gg/MCDdHfy)
* If you still believe that what you found is a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mu-box/core)

Please report bugs when you've exhausted all of the above options.

## Bug Report Checklist

* Make sure you are using the latest released version of Microbox before submitting a bug report. Bugs in versions older than the latest released one will not be addressed by the core team (so long as the version is not LTS).
* If you have found a bug it is important to add relevant information to reproduce it. This way the core team can find and fix it quicker.
* Please ensure that information such as OS and Microbox version are part of the bug report
* If available, you can also submit a [Segmentation Fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault) error

## Pull Request Checklist

* Don't submit your pull requests to the `master` branch. Branch from the required branch and, if needed, rebase to the proper branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master you may be asked to rebase your changes
* Don't put submodule updates in your pull request unless they are to landed commits 
* Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature. 

## Requesting Features

If you have a change or new feature in mind, please open an issue in GitHub, clearly marking it as a NFR.


Thanks!
